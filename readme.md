## To-Do List Web App
A simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helps users manage daily tasks by adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks dynamically.
The app also stores tasks locally in the browser so they remain saved even after refreshing the page.

## Features
 Add new tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Edit existing tasks
Delete tasks
 Save tasks using browser local storage
 Responsive design

## How It Works
User enters a task in the input field.
JavaScript captures the input and displays it in the task list.
Tasks can be marked complete, edited, or deleted.
All tasks are saved in localStorage, so they persist after reload.
